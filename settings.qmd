# Settings {.sec-profile}

We've added quite a few non-default settings, which will be automatically configured with this profile. Again, you might not like all of these â€” feel free to remove these from your settings.json file. 

Here is a list of some of these settings:

* Additional LaTeX recipes:
  * xelatex+ and pdflatex+ will actually build the accompanying files many times underneath the hood in order to make sure that your bibliography citations correspond correctly.
* LaTeX outline view will include the sections: part, chapter, section, subsection, subsubsection, and paragraph.
* Word wrapping
