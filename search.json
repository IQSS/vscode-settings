These include:\n\nAzure Repos:\n\nDependency for GitHub extensions.\n\nBetter Comments:\n\nColor codes types of comments with symbols at the beginning of each. For example, there are:\n\n“*” for highlighting a comment (green)\n“!” for an alert (red)\n“?” for a question (blue)\n“TODO” for a to-do (orange)\n“//” for a strikethrough\n\nYou can also customize your own.\n\nGitHub Copilot:\n\nIn-line suggestions: Copilot will anticipate what you are about to type. You can accept these suggestions, or keep typing.\n\nGitHub Copilot Chat:\n\nIn-line chat: You can use Cmd+I to start an inline chat, where you can ask Copilot to do something for you. One of my favorites is to ask Copilot “Can you write me the outline of a LaTeX document?”\nSide chat: You can open up a side-pane for a continuous chat with Copilot, much like Chat-GPT. You can ask Copilot to explain things to you, or to make suggestions.\n\nGitHub Pull Requests and Issues:\n\nAllows for a smoother integration of GitHub into VSCode.\n\nGitHub Repositories:\n\nAnother extension which helps to integrate your repositories into VSCode.\n\nindent-rainbow:\n\nHighlights vertically along indents, allowing you to see the different levels of structure in your code.\n\nLaTeX Utilities:\n\nExtension pack for LaTeX Workshop.
