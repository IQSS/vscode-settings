If you do not already have a GitHub account, we recommend following the instructions from GitHub.\n\nCopilot:\n\nOne of the main benefits of VSCode is its integration with GitHub Copilot, an AI pair programmer which helps you to more effectively and quickly write code.\nPlease use these instructions for setting up your GitHub Copilot account.\n\nSkim:\n\nSkim is a PDF viewer, which you can download from the internet. We recommend setting this as your default PDF viewer.\nOnce Skim is open, go to the top toolbar menu. Select Skim &gt; Settings.\nIn the settings pane that opens, click Sync on the top right.\nCheck off the boxes for “Check for file changes” and “Reload automatically”\nIn the PDF-TeX Sync support section, set the “Preset” to Visual Studio Code\n\nMikTex:\n\nMikTex is a TeX distribution which you can download from the internet.\nIf you already have a TeX distribution installed on your computer, you do not need to install MiKTeX as well.\n\nPandoc:\n\nPandoc allows you to knit .Rmd files to PDF files. You can install the latest release from the internet.",

These include:\n\nAzure Repos:\n\nDependency for GitHub extensions.\n\nBetter Comments:\n\nColor codes types of comments with symbols at the beginning of each. For example, there are:\n\n“*” for highlighting a comment (green)\n“!” for an alert (red)\n“?” for a question (blue)\n“TODO” for a to-do (orange)\n“//” for a strikethrough\n\nYou can also customize your own.\n\nGitHub Copilot:\n\nIn-line suggestions: Copilot will anticipate what you are about to type. You can accept these suggestions, or keep typing.\n\nGitHub Copilot Chat:\n\nIn-line chat: You can use Cmd+I to start an inline chat, where you can ask Copilot to do something for you. One of my favorites is to ask Copilot “Can you write me the outline of a LaTeX document?”\nSide chat: You can open up a side-pane for a continuous chat with Copilot, much like Chat-GPT. You can ask Copilot to explain things to you, or to make suggestions.\n\nGitHub Pull Requests and Issues:\n\nAllows for a smoother integration of GitHub into VSCode.\n\nGitHub Repositories:\n\nAnother extension which helps to integrate your repositories into VSCode.\n\nindent-rainbow:\n\nHighlights vertically along indents, allowing you to see the different levels of structure in your code.\n\nLaTeX Utilities:\n\nExtension pack for LaTeX Workshop. Includes quicker paste options, live snippets, and word count.\n\nLaTeX Workshop:\n\nIncludes many features, including snippets, shortcuts, and pdf-viewing.\n\nLive Preview:\n\nAllows you to see HTML previews inside VSCode.\n\nLTeX - LanguageTool grammar/spell checking:\n\nUnderlines potential spelling and grammar mistakes.\n\nPath Autocomplete:\n\nAutocompletes paths for files inside your repository.\n\nR:\n\nAllows you to use R in VSCode, with snippets and various viewer options.\n\nR Debugger:\n\nIntegrates the debugging process for R into VSCode.\n\nRainbow CSV:\n\nIf you view a CSV file inside VSCode, each variable will be color-coded (for easier viewing)\n\nRemote Repositories:\n\nDependency for GitHub extensions.\n\nSettings Cycler:\n\nNecessary for using special keyboard shortcuts to toggle settings on/off.\n\nToggle:\n\nNecessary for using special keyboard shortcuts to toggle settings on/off.\n\nvscode-icons:\n\nIncludes additional graphic icons for file types, etc., inside VSCode.\n\nWord Count:\n\nProvides additional word count support for markdown documents.\n\nZotero LaTeX:\n\nAllows for more smooth integration for Zotero in LaTeX documents.",
