# VSCode Application {.sec-installation}

Visual Studio Code has [instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/get-started/basics) for getting started.

You can download VSCode directly from their [website](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for your operating system.

Unzip the download (mine was called "VSCode-darwin-universal.zip"), and then click on the new application (Visual Studio Code). A pop-up will ask you if you want to open an app downloaded from the internet. Click open.
